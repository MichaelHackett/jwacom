JWacom 1.0
(C) Copyright 2004 Tue Haste Andersen <haste@diku.dk>


*ABOUT*
JWacom is a Java library for accessing properties of the Wacom tablets.
The library uses native methods, currently only Linux is supported. 
The library provides functions to query the device state, and event listeners
to listen for Wacom events.

*NEWS*
New since 1.0
- Fixed memory leak

*INSTALL*
Run "make" to build the shared library libjwacom.so and the jwacom.jar file. 
Place the libjwacom.so in your library path, eg. set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point 
to the directory where you
place the library. Set your classpath to point to the directory where jwacom.jar
is located, and you should be able to use the methods of jwacom.JWacom in your 
program to read the properties of the Wacom pointing device.

The API is documented in JWacom.java and an example is provided in 
JWacomTest.java. To run the test type "make test". The test program reads and
prints the pressure value of a stylus when the pointer is moved.

*LICENCE*
The library is free, and provided as-is. I take no responibility for any damage
or any other stuff caused by or done with the library. If you use it, I will be 
happy to know about it.
